# Electronic-device-price-prediction
 The objective of this project is to develop a software application that can forecast the price of a product using data collected from a database via a user interface. This example demonstrates
how the application accurately predicts the price of a laptop based on it's features and market price.
 The project consists in the following steps: loading the database; cleaning the data and extracting the desired information in a comprehensible format; split the data into an advantageous training/test ratio; use of multiple machine learning models on that data and selecting the best performing one; optimizing the results after model validation; exporting the model to a user interface; creating a web interface where users can choose desired device features and finally price prediction based on the input.
 This project is entirely written in Python, utilizing the appropriate libraries and methods.
