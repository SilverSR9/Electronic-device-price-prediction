## Description
<pre>
 The entirety of this program is written in python and to showcase it I used a dataset from Kaggle which contains around 1300 laptops classified by their characteristics and price.<br>
 The following steps were taken to do this:<br>
-processing the dataset and shaping it into an interpretable format as much as possible with Pandas and NumPy(in jupyter lab)<br>
-after processing, the database is split into training data and testing data before various machine learning models are applied<br>
-various machine learning algorithms were used and compared to determine which one can perform more accurately<br>
-the performance was tested using R-squared (RÂ²) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) coefficients<br>
-the model validity was examined by comparing the predicted values to actual values and by residual analysis<br>
-finally the model is serialized and exported(with Pickle) into a user interface(using Streamlit), where the desired device<br>
 characteristics can be selected by the user and the forecasting can be performed.
